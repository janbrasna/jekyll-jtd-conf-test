In general, cushaws will thrive under similar conditions to other squash. In Mexico near the likely origin of Curcubita argyrosperma, various strains of cushaws can be found growing in conditions that vary from intercropping with corn within intensive agricultural systems to feral and wild forms that self-seed.

In cool northern hemisphere climates, an area facing south is often best.

# Preparing a new garden bed

## Method 1: No-Till Cardboard Mulch

### Materials Needed:
- Cardboard sheets (without glossy coating or tape)
- Gardening tools (shovel, rake, wheelbarrow)
- Water source (optional)
- Rocks to hold down cardboard (optional)

### Steps:
1. **Site Selection**
   - Choose a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
   - Ensure the area has good drainage.
   - Measure and mark the desired garden bed dimensions.
   - Remove any large rocks, sticks, or debris from the area.
   - Ideally, the cardboard should be applied at three or more months in advance. Humid climates or manually wetting the cardboard can reduce this time.

2. **Cardboard Layer**
   - Make sure there are no glossy coatings or tapes on the cardboard
   - Lay down overlapping cardboard sheets directly over the grass/weeds
   - Ensure complete coverage with no gaps

3. **Issues with Wind**
   - Wind can carry away cardboard if it is on the top layer and has not yet begun breaking down.
   - In some situations it may not be a problem for a few sheets of cardboard to blow around.
   - Options for reducing this issue include placing rocks or mulch on top of the cardboard or periodically wetting it until the cardboard begins to decompose.

5. **Waiting Period**
   - Allow the bed to sit three months before planting, although sometimes it is possible to plant in less time.
   - This gives time for the cardboard to suppress weeds and decompose.
   - The layers will break down, improving ground conditions.

## Method 2: Tilling Approach

### Materials Needed:
- Rototiller or tractor with tilling attachment, etc.
- Rake
- Shovel
- Wheelbarrow

### Steps:
1. **Site Selection**
   - Choose a location with full sun exposure
   - Verify good drainage
   - Measure and mark garden bed dimensions

2. **Initial Preparation**
   - Remove large rocks, sticks, and debris
   - Mow or cut existing grass and weeds as short as possible

3. **Tilling Process**
   - Set rototiller or tractor to a depth of 8-12 inches
   - Till the entire area, breaking up compacted soil
   - Make multiple passes to ensure thorough soil disruption
   - Work when soil is slightly moist but not wet

4. **Final Bed Preparation**
   - Rake the area to create a smooth, level surface
   - Remove any remaining large clumps or roots
   - Create slight mounds or raised areas if drainage is a concern


### Growing Tips:
- This squash variety prefers warm soil temperatures (around 70°F)
- Plant after the last frost date in your region
- Space plants 3-4 feet apart in rows 6-8 feet apart
- Provide support like trellises for vertical growth


## Possibility of crossing

C. argyrosperma cushaws have been noted in English scientific literature to form interspecific hybrids with other Cucurbita squash. However, these hybrids should be considered unlikely to occur via natural pollination. Among the other squash species which are widely cultivated, Cucurbita moschata is often considered the most likely to hybridize with Cucurbita argyrosperma.

## Direct sowing

Squash seeds are easy to direct sow, and this is often the most effective choice assuming either an ample starting supply of seeds or an environment with low pest pressure.

To direct sow, drop individual seeds into a hole or furrow about ½” - 1” deep, cover with soil and press to make good contact. Seeds should be about 6” apart, a distance based on either nature or the gardener removing some plants as they grow to increase the amount of space per individual chilacayote plant.

Once the seeds have been planted, ensure that they are watered, whether by natural sources or by irrigation. With warmth and moisture, the seeds will germinate in a few days. By direct sowing, the tap root of the seedling can establish itself deeply in the soil, and avoid the risk of damage and shock that comes with transplantation.

## Starting cushaws indoors

Some situations call for starting indoors. For example, in short season climates, start seeds indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost, at least during the first year or two to harvest squash as close to maturity as possible.

When starting the seeds indoors, it can be useful to add some of your native soil to the potting mix so the seeds develop relationships with soil microbes right from the start.

## When to plant outside

Squash plants are not frost-tolerant, and prefer soil temperatures above 50 F. Note that plants started indoors may need to acclimate to the outdoors before planting in the ground.
